# SuperCert- Transcript Verification System for Engineering Colleges

SuperCert is a web application that can used to store academic transcripts issued by University immutably in blockchain in form of CID (CID is generated by storing the transcript in an IPFS prior to storing in blockchain.) The CID generated will be shared with students in form of raw hash (here we have done it using email) or QR Code. 
Students can share the recieved form of transcript (CID or QR code) with the university (higher education institutes) and they can use the same website to efficiently verify the same. 
Removes intermediary (here it is university where the student is affiliated with) and makes the process quick, simple and efficient for both student and verification authority.

This project uses following tools and technologies
- **Ethereum (Sepolia)**
- **React (frontend)**
- **ExpressJs (Backend)**
- **Pinata (IPFS)**
- **Hardhat and EtherJs (for interacting with blockchain)**
- **MongoDB (for logging trasactions)**

There are 3 main folders viz:
1. Client (for frontend)
2. Server (for mongoDB and RestAPIs)
3. Parent file (which contains contracts and abis)

Follow along with _README_ in each folder to correctly configure and execute the project
